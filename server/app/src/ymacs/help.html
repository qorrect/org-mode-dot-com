    <p>
        Ymacs is a keyboard driven editor that is <b>function driven</b> ( type `M-x TAB` to see a list of all
        functions available ) . These functions can be mapped to <a href="#"
                                                                    onclick="ymacs.callHooks(YmacsEvents.HREF_EVENT,'help-keyboard')">keyboard
        bindings</a> to execute them quickly. This repeatability lends itself to Emacs' namesake, <a
            href="http://www.emacs.org" target="_blank">editor macros</a>, recording and replaying keyboard sequences (
        which are really just a series of functions - we're composing more complex functions with lower level ones ) .
        See <a href="#" onclick="ymacs.callHooks(YmacsEvents.HREF_EVENT,'emacs_rocks')">this demo list</a> to see it in
        action.
